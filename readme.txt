If you want to use this code:
1. Check that all the instances files from Montoya et al. (2017) in xml format are on the "instances" folder.
2. Add all your solutions to the "solutions" folder.
3. Open the class "Main_Checker" in the "massiveChecking" package.
4. Run as a Java Application.

All your results and reports will be store on the "results" folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solutions for the second set of instances must end with a "-C1" or a "-C2". For example: tc2c10s2cf1-C2.xml

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The solutions folder includes 3 solutions. One solution for the tc2c10s2cf0 instance without CSs capacity and
two solutions for the tc2c10s2cf0 instance with capacity 1 and 2.
